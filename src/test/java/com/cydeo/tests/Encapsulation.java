       #1. Encapsulation is a Data hiding
•	An object hides its internal data from code that’s outside the class
•	Only the current class’ methods can directly access and make changes to the instance variable
•	Hide an instance variable by giving private access modifier, and making the methods that access those fields public
•	These public methods are called getters & setters (accessor and mutator)
